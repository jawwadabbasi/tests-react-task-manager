# React Frontend Test â€“ Task Manager

Build a simple React app that lets users create tasks and view a list of sample tasks. The form should include required fields like task name and due date, with an optional field for a description. On submit, save the task to localStorage, show a success message, and clear the form. When the app loads, check localStorage for tasks; if none exist, fetch 5 tasks from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos?_limit=5 and display them. Include a search input to filter tasks by name in real-time. Use React functional components with useState and useEffect. No Redux or external libraries.
